**New Config Option: `EnableDurabilityScaling`**
- Durability bonuses/penalties now work in BOTH Default and Advanced modes
- Previously, durability scaling was locked behind Advanced Mode
- New toggle allows players to get precision rewards without the hardcore fracture mechanics

**Config:**
```json
{
  "EnableDurabilityScaling": true  // true = bonuses/penalties active, false = always vanilla 100%
}
```ic
